# Installation

There are two ways to install the Lightning Multitool:

1.  **Using a pre-built binary (Recommended)**: Download the latest release from GitHub.
2.  **Building from source**: Clone the repository and build it yourself.

## Using a Pre-built Binary

This is the easiest way to get started.

    After downloading, you can run the binary from your terminal:

    ```bash

## Building from Source

    git clone https://github.com/asheswook/lnurl.git
    cd lnurl
    ```

2.  **Build the project**

    ```bash
    go build ./cmd/server/main.go -o lightning-multitool
    ```
